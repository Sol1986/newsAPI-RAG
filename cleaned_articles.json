A federal judge is siding with the Biden administration and blocking JetBlue Airways from buying Spirit Airlines, saying the $3.8 billion deal would reduce competition. The Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would drive up fares by eliminating Spirit, the nation’s biggest low-cost airline. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)The Associated PressNEW YORK -- JetBlue Airways warned that it may end its bid to acquire low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines as soon as this weekend after a federal judge blocked the deal, sending Spirit shares sharply lower Friday.Spirit shot back that it finds no reason to terminate the deal and will continue to meet its obligations, \"and it expects JetBlue to do the same.”A federal judge sided with the Justice Department and blocked JetBlue's proposed $3.8 billion purchase of Spirit last week. The Justice Department sued to block the merger, saying it would drive up fares by eliminating Spirit, the nation’s biggest low-cost airline.Both airlines have filed their intention to appeal with a higher court.JetBlue said in a regulatory filing Friday it told Spirit that certain conditions of their deal might not be met by the deadline set in the airlines’ 2022 agreement. JetBlue said that could lead it to terminate the deal as early as Sunday. Spirit responded hours later with its own filing that disputed JetBlue's position.“Spirit believes there is no basis for terminating the Merger Agreement,\" Spirit wrote. \"Spirit will continue to abide by all of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, and it expects JetBlue to do the same.”Shares of Spirit Airlines Inc., based in Miramar, Florida, fell 13.4% during Friday's session, while JetBlue Airways Corp. gained 3.6%.JetBlue, based in New York, had argued that it needed to buy Spirit to grow quickly and better compete against bigger rivals that dominate the U.S. air-travel market. Together, the two carriers would control about 10% of the domestic air-travel market, still smaller than American, Delta, United and Southwest. Both JetBlue and Spirit have struggled financially and have been slower than some other airlines to recover from the pandemic. Since the start of 2020, JetBlue has lost $2.1 billion, and Spirit has lost $1.7 billion. Spirit is dealing with rising costs, softer demand for its mix of rock-bottom fares but higher fees, and the sidelining of dozens of its Airbus jets because of problems with the Pratt & Whitney engines. It must figure out how to pay or refinance $1.1 billion in debt due next year. Spirit tried to merge with Frontier Airlines, another low-cost carrier, in early 2022, but JetBlue won a bidding war to push Frontier aside. Should the deal fall through because of government opposition, JetBlue could be saddled with a $470 million reverse breakup fee, $70 million for Spirit and $400 million for its share holders.

By Joseph MennUpdated January 26, 2024 at 8:19 p.m. EST|Published January 26, 2024 at 6:49 p.m. ESTNew rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to spark more disclosures of computer hacking incidents. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)Listen4 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveSecurity experts expect many more companies to disclose that they’ve been hacked by Russian intelligence agents who stole emails from executives following disclosures by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in the past week.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightMicrosoft said late Thursday that it had found more victims and was in the process of notifying them. A spokesperson declined to say how many. But three experts in and out of government said that the attack was deeper and broader than the disclosures to date reveal.Two said that more than 10 companies, and perhaps far more, are expected to come forward. The experts spoke on the condition of anonymity so as to maintain relations with the victims.The Securities and Exchange Commission last year strengthened the rules that require companies to notify their stockholders of computer intrusions that could have a material impact on company results. That helped spur the recent disclosures.AdvertisementMicrosoft, HPE and the experts said that Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service has been inside the targeted companies for months. It was not clear whether the Russians had used the same technique repeatedly to gain access to the companies’ systems.The SVR team, which Microsoft calls Midnight Blizzard, is regarded as one of the most proficient hacking forces in the world. Microsoft said the Russian agency had gotten a foothold inside its network by trying the same password on test accounts over and over until it found a match.While that is a rudimentary attack, the company said it was made harder to spot because the login attempts came from a number of different places. Once inside, the hackers created new accounts and new apps with more internal powers.Also known as Cozy Bear, the group last made international news for getting inside the software provider SolarWinds. It altered that company’s code, giving itself an entryway when federal agencies that were SolarWinds customers installed it.Advertisement“What sets this group apart is its remarkable combination of discretion, patience, and unwavering persistence, distinguishing them from other cyberthreat actors also funded and acting on behalf of nation-states,” said Aric Ward, a former threat analyst at the White House. “Their low profile is indicative of a stealthy and adept approach, making it clear that their actions persist even if they remain elusive from public scrutiny.”The Microsoft and HPE breaches are especially concerning because so many other companies and agencies rely on them for cloud services, including email. It is not yet known whether the hackers were able to use their access to Microsoft’s systems to conduct attacks on other companies.Eric Goldstein, the top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said it was working to learn more about the attack and its potential impact.Advertisement“As noted in Microsoft’s announcement, at this time we are not aware of impacts to Microsoft customer environments or products,” Goldstein said.Alex Stamos, a security executive at competitor SentinelOne, said Microsoft’s most recent blog post indicated the company had used a detection technique that only works on Microsoft-hosted cloud services. Stamos wrote on LinkedIn that this suggested that multiple targets had been hit with an attack method that works against Microsoft’s system for authorizing access, now called Entra and formerly known as Azure Active Directory.Microsoft said that the SVR searched through the email of its cybersecurity experts to find out what they knew about the Russian organization, which may reflect the company’s effectiveness in helping Ukraine deter cyberattacks since the invasion two years ago.Advertisement“It’s their goal to penetrate systems of interest to them, but given Microsoft’s role in the world and how helpful they have been to Ukraine, they’re going to be a target,” said George Barnes, who recently retired as the deputy director of the National Security Agency.The Microsoft executives’ emails are also likely to contain conversations with government officials that would be useful for foreign intelligence agencies.Share CommentsSign upTOP STORIESTechnologyBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devicesMark Zuckerberg joins struggle over Harvard’s futureApple and Google are losing power.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Updated Jan 27, 2024, 6:15 AM UTC|CommentsShare this story Illustration: The VergeWas it a joyous outage where you got to relax, or did something mission-critical go wrong? Either way, “a portion” of Microsoft Teams went down Friday for over eight hours — with outages in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, according to status updates from Microsoft’s official account. At 8:17PM ET Friday, Microsoft tweeted that the worst is over, but that the company was still mopping up, with a handful of issues still ongoing. Shortly after midnight Saturday, the company called the all-clear: “we’ve confirmed that our Microsoft Teams service and features have been restored or have returned to optimal health,” it writes. So yeah, if you couldn’t communicate with your colleagues via Microsoft’s biz comm platform, that’s probably why. We’d seen reports of users not being able to log into Teams at all, while others saw missing messages, missing attachments, delays, and more. As of late Friday, Microsoft had already gotten to the point where you should’ve be able to log in, load messages, view media, and access call recordings — but that anonymous users might still have been unable to join meetings, seen delays, had trouble rejoining meetings or loading Copilot history, and that you probably shouldn’t reboot your computer if you need to log into Teams since that was an issue too.The spike in problem reports at DownDetector suggested this outage had been going on for at least three hours at the time we originally published our story, and Microsoft officially recognized the issue at around 11:45AM ET. The company said it identified “a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service,” and began failovers to resolve the problem. Four hours later, though, Microsoft reported that “Our failover operation did not provide immediate relief to all end users in North and South America regions.” While the DownDetector spike has subsided, it’s not clear whether that’s because services are substantially restored or because there’s no point complaining anymore.Here’s how far Microsoft got by the eight-hour mark:We’re continuing to apply mitigations across the affected infrastructure and our telemetry is showing additional improvement in the user experience, though many customers are still affected by this issue. We’re also working to apply fixes to address individual affected Teams features in parallel while our broader remediation strategy is ongoing. We’re evaluating any and all additional workstreams that will allow us to reduce the impact to those customers that are still affected. It took roughly 13 hours for Microsoft to completely address the issue. If you had access to a Microsoft Teams admin console, you were able to check the status at TM710344.For hours after the outage began, Microsoft’s status page was all green, suggesting Microsoft Teams was fine, but it updated with a lengthy description shortly before 2PM ET, including that “We’ve completed a failover in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region and telemetry is showing improvement,” and that it planned to take similar steps in other regions.IT admins saw a similar message in their dashboards around 1PM ET, according to an r/sysadmin user: Here’s Microsoft’s final update on the outage:Title: Some users may experience multiple issues with their Microsoft TeamsUser impact: Users may have experienced multiple issues with their Microsoft Teams.More info: Affected scenarios included, but weren’t limited to the following:- Users logging in or unlocking their devices after some time may have had missing messages.- Users may have been unable to load messages in channels and chats.- Users were unable to view or download their media (images, videos, audio, call recordings, code snippets).- Some users were experiencing delays sending and receiving chat messages.- Anonymous users may have been unable to join meetings.- Teams connectors for Power Automate/Power Apps were experiencing errors.-Call Recordings might take longer to appear in user’s OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online.- Users may have been unable to load previous Copilot history, or new history was not written- Bots may have been unable to download attachments- Sending and receiving read receipt notifications may have been delayed- Users may have experienced issues resuming or rejoining meetings.- Users within organizations leveraging an Information Barrier may have experienced issues joining meetings- Users performing a cold boot may have been unable to log into teams and would have seen an “oops” pageFinal status: After extended monitoring and various optimizations and mitigation efforts, we’ve confirmed that our Microsoft Teams service and features have been restored or returned to optimal health.Start time: Friday, January 26, 2024, at 2:55 PM UTCEnd time: Saturday, January 27, 2024, at 1:30 AM UTCThis is the final update for the event.Microsoft Teams had a four-hour outage almost exactly a year ago. It had a pair of large outages in 2021, and ones in 2020 and in 2019, too, but this eight-hour-plus outage may take the cake — depending on how many people were affected, anyhow.Update, 8:00PM ET: Added that the outage is still ongoing, and Microsoft’s latest update.Update, 9:04PM ET: Added that the outage seems to be mostly over, but a number of specific issues remain.Update January 26th, 1:13AM ET: Story now reflects that the outage is over and includes Microsoft’s final updates.CommentsMost PopularTrolls have flooded X with graphic Taylor Swift AI fakesMonkey Man’s new trailer feels like a warning shot fired at John WickMozilla says Apple’s new browser rules are ‘as painful as possible’ for FirefoxMicrosoft Teams went down around the world for over eight hours — it’s better nowFossil is quitting smartwatchesVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The agency’s prosecutors have accused the company of illegally retaliating against workers, firing a union supporter and spreading false information in an effort to chill an organizing campaign.But in a hearing last Tuesday, the grocer’s attorney briefly summarized a sweeping defense it intends to mount against the charges: The labor board itself, which was created during the New Deal and has refereed private-sector collective bargaining for nearly 90 years, is “unconstitutional.”Advertisement The argument would appear to fit inside a broader conservative effort to dismantle the regulatory state, which has taken aim at agencies tasked with enforcing laws to protect workers, consumers and the environment.The exchange, a transcript of which HuffPost obtained through a public records request, came at the start of a trial to determine whether Trader Joe’s violated workers’ rights. Trader Joe’s’ attorney, Christopher Murphy of the law firm Morgan Lewis, informed the judge, Charles Muhl, that there was “one final thing” the grocery chain wanted to add to its defense before proceedings began.“The National Labor Relations Act as interpreted and/or applied in this matter, including but not limited to the structure and organization of the National Labor Relations Board and the agency’s administrative law judges, is unconstitutional,” Murphy said.Murphy added that the company was making the “affirmative defense” now so that it could argue it in full later. The company’s defense was first reported by Bloomberg.Advertisement The judge said he would allow it into the record, but left it at that.“I’m certainly not going to be ruling on my own constitutionality anytime soon,” he deadpanned. “So you’ll have to take that up with the board and the federal courts.”“I see something really insidious here. Is Trader Joe’s onboard with what their law firm is doing?”- Seth Goldstein, attorney for Trader Joe's UnitedTrader Joe’s does not appear to have expanded on the defense yet during trial, and there are no briefs yet laying out its logic. But the company may be using an argument similar to one recently made in federal court by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company, which NLRB prosecutors have also accused of labor law violations. SpaceX claims that the NLRB violates the constitutional separation of powers as well as the right to due process, calling the board “the very definition of tyranny,” as Politico recently reported. An attorney for Trader Joe's said one of the companies defenses against union-busting charges is that the National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional.John Greim via Getty ImagesAdvertisement Like Trader Joe’s, SpaceX is represented by Morgan Lewis. The firm is known for its management-side work helping employers battle unions. Some of its highest-profile attorneys came out of the NLRB and served as conservative board members. A Trader Joe’s spokesperson did not immediately respond Friday when asked for comment.Seth Goldstein, an attorney for Trader Joe’s United, the union that’s accused the grocer of illegal retaliation, told HuffPost he finds it disturbing that the idea of dismantling the NLRB has been “mainstreamed.” He said the argument would align Trader Joe’s with right-wing ideologues. “I see something really insidious here,” said Goldstein, who’s with the firm Julien, Mirer, Singla and Goldstein. “Is Trader Joe’s onboard with what their law firm is doing?”The NLRB is an independent federal agency that was created to protect workers’ rights and foster labor peace. It has both a prosecutorial office, which brings cases against employers and unions, and a 5-member board, which interprets the laws governing bargaining in the private sector. The agency’s administrative law judges issue rulings that can be appealed to the 5-member board for review. The agency’s constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1937, two years after it was created. However, these days, the court’s conservative supermajority has been chipping away at the regulatory state. (SpaceX’s claims track with some of the arguments made in a case involving the Securities and Exchange Commission that’s currently before the Supreme Court, SEC v. Jarkesy.)Advertisement Both employers and unions have plenty of gripes about the NLRB and board processes. But a determination that the NLRB itself is unconstitutional could throw labor relations into turmoil. Goldstein said the argument signals to Trader Joe’s workers that the company believes “our members don’t have the right to organize at all.”“This is really dangerous,” Goldstein said. “Are we really going back to 1920?”Support HuffPostThe Stakes Have Never Been HigherAt HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

Credit: Spaceport America WASHINGTON — Virgin Galactic conducted its first suborbital mission of 2024 on Jan. 26 as the company prepares end flights of its current spaceplane. The VSS Unity spaceplane, attached the VMS Eve mothership aircraft, took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at 12 p.m. Eastern. Unity separated about 45 minutes later, igniting its hybrid rocket engine. The vehicle reached a peak altitude of 88.8 kilometers before gliding back to a runway landing at the spaceport at 12:56 p.m. Eastern, according to data provided by the company The flight, called Galactic 06 by Virgin Galactic, carried four customers for the first time, along with its two pilots. Previous commercial flights had three customers on board along with a Virgin Galactic astronaut trainer. As with some recent flights, Virgin Galactic disclosed the identities of the four private astronauts only after the end of the mission. They are Americans Neil Kornswiet and Robie Vaughn, Ukrainian-American Lina Borozdina and Austrian Franz Haider. Unity was commanded by C.J. Sturckow with Nicola Pecile as pilot. Virgin Galactic also did not provide a webcast of the launch, as on some previous flights, instead providing updates on social media. Those updates significantly lagged behind the timing of flight activities: the post on X (formerly Twitter) announcing the landing of Unity at the conclusion was published more than 35 minutes after landing. “The success of Galactic 06 and the company’s other commercial spaceflights in recent months only increases our confidence in the repeatability of our product and our ability to deliver a superlative experience to our customers,” Michael Colglazier, chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said in a statement. The flight was the first since a dedicated research flight, Galactic 05, Nov. 2. That flight was the sixth in less than six months for the vehicle, but Virgin Galactic said it would pause flights until January for an annual maintenance period. Just a week after Galactic 05, though, Virgin Galactic announced it would soon wind down flights of VSS Unity, citing the need to conserve its cash reserves for development of its next-generation Delta class of suborbital vehicles. Those future vehicles are intended to fly more frequently and at lower costs than Unity. Virgin Galactic said then that, after Galactic 06, it would fly Unity again on Galactic 07 in the second quarter of the year and, perhaps, a Galactic 08 mission in mid-2024. The company then plans to retire VSS Unity and shift resources into Delta-class vehicle development. “With the production of our next-generation Delta-class ships underway, we look forward to expanding our flight capacity with testing expected to start next year and commercial service in 2026,” Colglazier said in the statement. The company confirmed in the statement that Galactic 07 will take place in the second quarter and fly a researcher along with private astronauts. It did not provide other details about the flight.

This is a sign of how fickle the market can be, but I encourage you to look at the big picture and make your own decisions. When the dust settles in a while, I expect the market to appreciate Intel again, and for the long term, I am bullish on INTC stock.Intel is a chipmaker that, unlike some of the company’s competitors, actually manufactures its own microchips. Having a foundry business is risky, no doubt, but it’s what sets Intel apart.Today’s INTC stock dumpage is a textbook example of how investor sentiment can turn on a dime. In just a year’s time, Intel has gone from doghouse to darling and back. Don’t be frustrated at the market’s wild mood swings, though, since irrational behavior leads to volatility, and volatility leads to opportunity.The Good News That No One is Talking About INTC stock is down 12% today, even though there are multiple positive news items to report. In effect, the market is so hyper-focused on Intel’s quarterly report and forward guidance that it’s completely overlooking some important developments concerning Intel.First of all, Intel just celebrated the opening of the company’s factory in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. According to Keyvan Esfarjani, Intel executive vice president and chief global operations officer, this represents the “opening of Intel’s first high-volume semiconductor operations and the only U.S. factory producing the world’s most advanced packaging solutions at scale.”Furthermore, Intel announced a collaboration with Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC) to develop a “12-nanometer semiconductor process platform to address high-growth markets such as mobile, communication infrastructure and networking.” It’s interesting that Intel is partnering with a Taiwanese foundry business like United Microelectronics Corporation.With this Taiwan-based partnership, could Intel and UMC be poised to steal significant market share from Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)? It’s a question that ought to be considered, but hardly anyone’s thinking about it today.Story continuesThe Market Can’t Tolerate Cautious GuidanceTo be blunt, the market is so spoiled that it won’t tolerate anything but a full-on beat-and-raise anymore. Sometimes, there’s a beat-and-raise, but the earnings beat and/or the guidance raise isn’t high enough to impress investors. It’s a strange phenomenon – but again, irrationality leads to opportunity.With its results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, Intel definitely achieved the “beat” part of the beat-and-raise formula. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger had every right to boast, saying, “We delivered strong Q4 results, surpassing expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter with revenue at the higher end of our guidance.”Here’s the rundown. Intel’s quarterly revenue grew by 10% year-over-year to $15.4 billion, beating analysts’ consensus expectations by $230 million. Moreover, Wall Street called for Intel to post Fiscal Q4-2023 earnings of $0.45 per share, but the company actually earned $0.54 per share.After INTC doubled from $24 and change to $50, you might assume that Intel’s Street-beating quarterly results would send the share price higher. Yet, Intel didn’t deliver the “raise” part of the beat-and-raise combo that people expect nowadays.Specifically, Intel provided a current-quarter revenue guidance range of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion, while analysts’ consensus forecast called for $14.2 billion in revenue. In addition, whereas Wall Street forecast adjusted Fiscal Q1-2024 earnings of $0.32 per share, Intel’s management only guided for $0.13 per share.In light of this, a number of analysts have turned cautious on INTC stock. Two examples are Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon and Stifel Nicolaus’s Ruben Roy, who recently published Hold/Neutral ratings on Intel shares. Furthermore, Rasgon’s $42 price target and Roy’s $45 price target aren’t particularly optimistic.Think about it – Intel stock would have to go practically nowhere for the next 12 months in order to land at those price targets. Yet, the company’s results demonstrate that Intel is capable of surpassing Wall Street’s financial estimates. Now that the current-quarter expectations are quite low, don’t be too surprised if there’s another earnings beat coming — though I can’t guarantee a beat-and-raise, which everybody seems to demand now.Is Intel Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?On TipRanks, INTC comes in as a Hold based on seven Buys, 24 Holds, and four Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Intel stock price target is $46.38, implying 6.5% upside potential.Conclusion: Should You Consider Intel Stock?Intel set the bar low for the current quarter. Investors reacted badly to this, but that’s how opportunities arise. All of this could just be a setup for another earnings beat and more optimistic guidance in a few months.It’s difficult to envision a good outcome when the market’s sentiment is so negative about Intel. Bear in mind, though, that investors favored Intel just a few days ago. They’ll come to appreciate Intel again, I predict, so I feel that it’s smart to consider INTC stock while it’s trading at a reduced price.DisclosureRelated QuotesSymbolLast PriceChange% ChangeINTCIntel Corporation43.65-5.90-11.91%TRENDING 1.

Shares of Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle giant have dropped 26% this month, wiping out $205 billion in market valuation. The stock is on pace to close lower for the sixth straight week, its longest losing streak since 2016. For perspective, at that point Tesla hadn’t even launched its first mass-market car, the Model 3. “There’s no floor in this stock in the near term,” Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview. “Investors are scratching their heads. If Tesla is lowering its forecast and is not bullish on the near term, why should investors be bullish.” There are plenty of reasons for the selloff. The auto industry is warning about plunging demand for EVs. Hertz Global Holding Inc., the rental-car behemoth, pulled back from plans to expand its electric vehicle fleet, and Ford Motor Co. said it was seeing a weaker market for them. Meanwhile, Tesla instituted multiple price cuts, sparking worries about thinning margins. Then came Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings report, when the company said it expected to expand at a “notably lower” rate in 2024, but did not given any further details. The stock tanked on the news. Bulls bail Since then, at least two analysts have downgraded the stock, while several have cut their price targets on the stock. The average price target on Tesla has fallen by nearly 8% since Tuesday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and now sits at $220.34. The shares are trading at around $185. Long-time bullish Tesla analyst, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, removed the stock from his “Best Ideas List,” saying the lack of details on price cuts, outlook, demand from the company is “a bitter pill to swallow for the bulls.” Ives still has a buy equivalent rating on the stock, but has also lowered his price target. The stock could stay in flux for a while, considering Tesla’s reluctance to lay out a roadmap and an EV winter that’s expected to plague the entire industry this year. “Tesla’s December results and outlook effectively pushed back the positive inflection point in the business by a year,” said Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management. “Now it looks to be the second half of 2025 before revenue growth will accelerate. In the near-term, shares will likely drift lower in what will be a vacuum of good news.” Still, for a stock that can move vigorously in either direction once sentiment shifts, this month’s sharp dive also could open the doors to a quick bounce back. Technical signals suggest the stock has dropped into “oversold” territory, which typically signals a coming reversal. The violent drop “in less than one month has taken it to the kind of oversold level that has only been exceeded once since it went public,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., wrote in a note on Friday. “This stock might have further to fall before it reaches its ultimate bottom, but the odds that it will see a bounce over the near-term are getting quite high.” Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business.

(WDRB) -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. plans to build an $800 million data center in southern Indiana's River Ridge Commerce Center.Gov. Eric Holcomb made the announcement Thursday, saying it gives him high confidence that Indiana could become the \"AI (artificial intelligence) capital of the Midwest.\"\"Having access to what you all provide to the world (Meta) right here, growing it right here in Indiana, leads us to a level of high confidence that we're going to end up being the AI capital of the Midwest. We have set some pretty lofty goals,\" Holcomb said. It will be the company's 18th data center in the U.S. and 22nd in the world. Data centers require large investments in computer servers and consume vast amounts of electricity but create few permanent jobs relative to their capital investments. The Meta data center will employ about 100 people for its operations and up to 1,250 people during construction.Jeffersonville Mayor Mike Moore called it \"the biggest announcement ever made out of Jeffersonville, Clark County.\" Moore said the conversations about this project have been in the works since 2019.\"COVID slowed us down for a little bit there, but, just like the economy in Jeffersonville, things fire back up,\" Moore said.The data center will be fully powered by renewable energy, as all Meta data centers are, according to Holcomb's office.\"Jeffersonville is the perfect home for Meta,\" said Brad Davis, director of data center community and economic development for Meta. \"It offers great access to infrastructure, renewable energy, strong pool of talent, and most important, an amazing set of community partners.\"Davis said this data center will be part of the infrastructure that helps bring technologies and services to billions of people across the world.\"It has a whole bunch of different network server computers that are storing, processing, and transmitting data,\" he explained.Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, will build a nearly 700,000-square-foot facility at the River Ridge Commerce Center. It will be the company's 18th data center in the U.S. and 22nd in the world, according to Holcomb's office. Davis said Jeffersonville quickly made it to the top of the list with a shovel-ready location for this campus, which will be on a site spanning more than 600 acres.\"An $800 million investment in our city. People. Do you recognize the effects of that? That that's going to have? I mean, that's not only for the employees in that building, but that entire campus,\" said Moore.Moore said this announcement is a \"huge day\" for Jeffersonville.\"It's a domino effect. The stronger the company's base that you bring in, the more influence it has on all the positive things that we want to continue in Jeffersonville,\" Moore said.Moore also praised the work Meta does with area schools in locations where it creates data centers. \"In each data center community, we partner with schools and local organizations on programs and resources to help build skills and increase the use of technology,\" said Davis. \"Once this data center is online, we'll launch or Meta Data Center Community Action Grants, a program created to address local needs by putting the power of technology to use for community benefit. Connecting people both online and off, and improving STEM education.\" Construction will start this month and the facility will be operational in 2026, according to the news release.\"If you're looking for a place to live right now, Jeffersonville, Indiana is it and you may never work for Meta but you're going to reap the benefits of it,\" said Moore.More Southern Indiana Business News:$800 million solar cell manufacturing facility being built in southern IndianaCheesecake Factory to open $74 million bakery and distribution center in southern IndianaDeveloper's vision for Jeffboat site along Ohio River will take Jeffersonville's past into its futureRiver Ridge announces new $1.8 million infrastructure investment on new developmentCity of Jeffersonville excited for continued growth as new businesses steadily open in the areaCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

Intel shares fell nearly 12%, with peers AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) also taking a slight knock.The release of the PCE index for December offered more evidence that inflation continues to moderate. \"Core\" PCE, the inflation gauge commonly known as the Fed's preferred measure, fell below 3% on an annual basis, the slowest rate of growth since March 2021.That number, combined with a hotter-than-expected early estimate on fourth quarter US GDP, could further the notion that the US economy is headed for a \"soft landing.\"Central bankers will huddle next week for their first policy meeting of the year. They are widely expected to keep interest rates steady. But the latest string of positive economic data will likely prompt them to begin cutting rates later this year, perhaps as early as March. The fresh figures showing robust economic growth create a delicate balancing act for Fed officials as kicking off an easing cycle too early may invite inflation to ramp back up.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsAt the same time, investors parsed Friday's batch of earnings for more insight into the health of corporate America and the economy.

Brent (BZ=F) futures, the international benchmark, also closed at $83.55 per barrel.Houthi rebels have continued to launch attacks on vessels in the Red Sea region, which an increasing number of cargo companies have been avoiding.In the US, freezing temperatures have impacted production across North Dakota, and crude inventories fell more than analysts had anticipated last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.Chinese measures to stimulate the country’s banking center and a hotter-than-expected preliminary US economic growth print also helped send futures higher.Meanwhile in the natural gas space, the Biden Administration announced a pause on export approvals for liquified natural gas (LNG) sent to non-Free Trade agreement countries, in order to assess environmental impacts of future projects.“This decision could lead to delays in final investment decisions (FIDs) for some projects as well depending on how long the pause in approvals lasts,” Fauzeya Rahman, LNG market specialist at ICIS, told Yahoo Finance.Fri, January 26, 2024 at 11:45 AM PSTHamza ShabanThe Fed weighs cooling inflation and robust growth Friday's promising PCE reading showed inflation continues to fall, but hotter-than-expected economic growth could steer the Federal Reserve to push its first rate cut to later in the year, giving central bankers time to parse through more data.As labor markets are more balanced and inflation has moderated, central bankers are pleased with the overall picture of the economy, which analysts with Bank of America Global Research highlighted in a note earlier this week.“We continue to expect the first rate cut in March, though we expect no strong signal in January,” they said. “The Fed needs to buy time to see more data.”If economic growth continues to surprise to the upside and inflation pops back up, the Fed may be forced to hold rates at current levels for longer, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. The US central bank last raised rates in July, to a 22-year high.During the December Fed press conference, Fed Chair Jay Powell signaled the central bank had likely reached the peak on rate hikes and would turn attention to rate cuts looking ahead. But even as optimistic data continues to roll in, the timing of the cuts is still up for debate.The Fed will hold their first policy meeting of the year next week.As of Friday afternoon traders were anticipating a 47% chance that the Fed will lower rates at the March meeting. That figure rises to nearly 90% for the probability of a cut in May.The January meeting will provide the latest clues on where Chair Powell and his colleagues are headed next.Fri, January 26, 2024 at 11:00 AM PSTAlexandra CanalMedia layoff frenzy extends into 2024The media and entertainment industry's reckoning will continue in 2024 with more layoffs as rising costs and debt-ridden balance sheets continue to weigh on the embattled sector.Here's what top media and entertainment companies have in mind when it comes to layoffs in 2024:Paramount GlobalAs M&A rumors swirl about the future of the Paramount Global (PARA), CEO Bob Bakish announced layoffs in an internal memo obtained by Yahoo Finance on Thursday.The executive cited the need to \"operate as a leaner company and spend less.\"\"As it has over the past few years, this does mean we will continue to reduce our workforce globally. These decisions are never easy, but are essential on our path to earnings growth,\" the memo read.YouTubeNot even tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has been immune to layoffs.Last week, the company cut 100 YouTube employees from its creator management and operations divisions, a spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo Finance — its first corporate restructuring in a decade. YouTube has 7,173 employees worldwide.The workforce reduction comes after Alphabet slashed thousands of jobs across its engineering, hardware, and advertising teams in an effort to reduce head count.Universal Music GroupUniversal Music Group (UMG), one of the industry's most prominent record labels, plans to lay off hundreds of employees later this quarter, according to Bloomberg.While UMG wouldn't fully confirm the report, a spokesperson hinted at the cuts in a company statement provided to Yahoo Finance: \"We are creating efficiencies in other areas of the business so we can remain nimble and responsive to the dynamic market, while realizing the benefits of our scale.\"PixarDisney's (DIS) animation unit will reportedly lay off as much as 20% of its 1,300 employees, according to TechCrunch. The cuts come as streaming profitability lags while the company's box office has struggled.Disney did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for confirmation on the report.Business InsiderThe online publication, a subsidiary of German publisher Axel Springer SE, said Thursday it will cut \"about 8%\" of its staff — a recent trend that's permeated across major news organizations throughout the country. (See Los Angeles Times next.)\"We closed out last year with a plan in place, a clear target audience, and a vision,\" Business Insider CEO Barbara Peng wrote in a memo to staff. \"This year is about making it happen and focusing our company and efforts towards this future. Unfortunately, this also means we need to scale back in some areas of our organization.\"Los Angeles TimesThe Los Angeles Times announced sweeping layoffs on Tuesday that eliminated the jobs of at least 115 staff members, or roughly 20% of its newsroom.The workforce reduction was the largest in the newspaper's 142-year history, according to the Times.The paper's owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, said the cuts were necessary in order to account for the loss of as much as $40 million a year due to a bleak advertising environment.Sports IllustratedOne of the most storied sports publications laid off most (or possibly all) of its staff last week after its publisher, Arena Group Holdings, had its license to operate the publication revoked.Arena Group failed to make a $3.8 million quarterly licensing payment to Authentic Brands Group, which has owned the magazine since 2019. Authentic Brands Group sold the publishing rights to Arena Group in a 10-year deal that same year.Read more here.

The firm upgraded Coinbase's stock from Perform to Outperform, setting a price target of $160 per share. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the most popular cryptocurrency, is also rebounding above $41,000 following a dip a week after spot bitcoin ETFs were approved.Intel (INTC): Shares of the chipmaker fell more than 10% following the release of first quarter guidance that fell below Wall Street expectations. The selling ramped up despite the company showing an all-around fourth quarter 2023 earnings beat — posting revenue of $15.4 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.Spirit Airlines (SAVE): Shares sank as much as 13% on Friday afternoon after JetBlue (JBLU) told the low-cost carrier that it may seek to terminate its merger agreement. JetBlue shares rose more than 2% following the warning, in which the airline cited certain conditions required by the pact that may not be met.Fri, January 26, 2024 at 9:44 AM PSTHamza ShabanStocks mixed in afternoon trading Stocks struggled to find clear direction Friday afternoon, following initial losses and then mixed results as investors attempted to look past some lackluster earnings while embracing the latest inflation reading that showed pricing pressures continuing to moderate.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped below the flatline but was set for a winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1% or about 44 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.3%.Fri, January 26, 2024 at 9:00 AM PSTHamza ShabanElon Musk's AI start up seeks to raise up to $6 billion: Report Elon Musk is ramping up his efforts to develop AI technology outside of his all-electric car company.According to a new report in the Financial Times published on Friday, Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI is in talks to raise up to $6 billion at a proposed valuation of $20 billion.The fundraising effort comes as much of the tech industry scrambles to rapidly develop new generative AI tools and claim market share in a nascent field that's believed to have the potential to revolutionize economic life.The startup has courted investors around the world in recent weeks including family offices in Hong Kong according to the report, which cites people familiar with the matter. But raising money in a territory that is increasingly controlled by Beijing could present regulatory issues, the report noted, as Washington seeks to heighten export controls to limit China's ability to develop advanced technologies.The report comes as Musk has pushed Tesla to award him greater control over the company by boosting his stake or granting him a new class of super-voting shares. Musk has said that he is uncomfortable helping Tesla become a leader in AI without having greater influence over company decisions. He has threatened to take his vision for the development of AI and robotics outside the company if his request for greater influence is not granted.Fri, January 26, 2024 at 8:41 AM PSTHamza ShabanStocks trending in morning tradingHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:Intel (INTC): Shares of the chipmaker fell more than 10% Friday morning following the release of first quarter guidance that fell below Wall Street expectations.

CEO Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance Live that the devaluations of the Argentine peso were partly to blame for the miss.Spirit Airlines (SAVE): Shares sank as much as 17% on Friday morning after JetBlue (JBLU) told the low-cost carrier that it may seek to terminate its merger agreement. JetBlue shares rose more than 2% following the warning, in which the airline cited certain conditions required by the pact that may not be met.Visa (V): The payment card services company shed 1% after the company posted its first quarter earnings, revealing an earnings beat with $8.6 billion in revenue versus an expected $8.57 billion and marking a year-over-year gain of nearly 9%. Some analysts pointed to forward guidance as a reason for the stock drop. US payments volume growth faded over the quarter in what could indicate an economic slowdown.Fri, January 26, 2024 at 7:53 AM PSTHamza ShabanModerating inflation reinforces Fed rate cutting story of 'not if but when' The Fed's ongoing public debate about when to begin an easing cycle intensified further Friday after the central bank's preferred inflation gauge moved below 3% for the first time since March 2021, before the start of the aggressive rate-hiking campaign.The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index grew 2.6% year over year in December, in line with last month's print. \"Core\" PCE, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, down from 3.2% from the month prior and below the 3.0% economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.Expectations remain that the Fed will be discussing “when — not if” to start lowering rates at its upcoming meeting policy meeting, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.The market had broadly anticipated that the first rate cut would arrive in March. But a number of Fed officials have pumped the brakes on that narrative. They've doubling down on their data-driven strategy, forgoing a momentous decision to start easing rates in favor of waiting for more confirmation that inflation has been thoroughly tamed.\"Although inflationary pressures continue to normalize with 'core' numbers inching ever closer to the Fed’s 2% target, the Fed will continue to monitor the effect of stronger consumer spending coupled with the promise of fiscal stimulus on igniting a bout of inflation,\" Krosby said.As of Friday morning traders were anticipating a 47% chance that the Fed will lower rates at the March meeting.

The Long Island City, N.Y.-based company said it continues to evaluate its options under the agreement.The development lowers the probability that Spirit Airlines' $3.8 billion sale to JetBlue (JBLU) will go through since a court ruling last week blocked the merger over antitrust concerns.Both companies have since filed to appeal the federal judge's ruling.On Friday morning Spirit pushed back against JetBlue's warning, stating \"there is no basis\" for terminating the merger agreement.

Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photo: Cora Veltman/Sportico via Getty Images Two years ago this month, Netflix warned investors that it saw growth slowing down during the first half of 2022 — and the result was nothing short of a Wall Street freakout. The streamer’s share price fell by nearly 20 percent, overnight, and this column published an edition headlined “The Great Netflix Panic of ’22.” Cassandras everywhere crawled out from their rocks with messages of doom and gloom, and to a degree, they weren’t totally wrong. Netflix’s year actually did get a lot worse: It ended up losing subscribers for a quarter, its stock price cratered to one-third of what it had been at the end of 2021, and it did things it long said it would never do (like offering an ad-supported tier). But while Netflix course-corrected that winter — and again following an even worse earnings report that spring — what execs at the company did not do was panic. They didn’t rush out to buy another studio or jump into the linear business; they didn’t get out of the movie business or dramatically cut theirs content spend. They simply tried to stay true to Netflix’s core mission (serving up more entertainment content more effectively than any other streamer) and hoped it would be enough to start adding subscribers again and start making more money. And this week, two years after that very dark January day in 2022, they offered the clearest proof yet that their strategy was working: ➽ On Tuesday, Netflix said it added over 13 million subscribers in the last three months of 2023, marking its strongest fourth quarter ever. Given how much bigger the company is now than ten years ago, that’s stunning. It now has over 260 million subscribers, having added nearly 30 million paying customers in the last year. ➽ A big chunk of Netflix’s growth last year was the result of its decision to start cracking down on password sharing among its customers, a practice it once openly encouraged. While the move might have made the streamer’s brand less golden among some of its longtime users, it boosted revenue and helped grow the platform’s less-expensive ad-supported tier. That’s particularly good news since advertising offers a potentially huge new revenue stream for Netflix if it can convince enough customers to accept ads. ➽ Toward that goal, Netflix Tuesday also announced a massive ten-year, $5 billion-plus seal with the WWE that will bring live wrestling showcase Raw to the streamer in 2025, and — outside of the U.S. — a slew of other WWE programming. The decision represents the closest Netflix has come to live sporting events, though the company considers the WWE “sports entertainment” and thus not the same as the NFL or NBA. Whatever the semantics, the deal should prove effective at getting new customers who aren’t that into dramas and comedies to sign up for Netflix. And more importantly, because the show is in production year-round, it could be a potent weapon in fighting churn. It’s doubtful many wrestling fans are going to sign up for a month or two of Netflix and binge a year’s worth of matches. ➽ Netflix also got good news on the awards front: Its 2023 movie slate snagged 18 nominations, including a best picture nod for Maestro. That tally gave it more noms than any other single studio this year, surpassing the 13 for Apple. This week also saw an announcement that Netflix film chief Scott Stuber, who helped build the streamer into a legit studio, would be departing later this year. But the news didn’t really seem to bother the creative community, which had been expecting Stuber to depart for some time, per reports in the trades. ➽ The best news of all for Netflix was that the same Wall Street investors who had a meltdown two years ago have now rekindled their ardent love for the company. Shares of the streamer rose by more than 15 percent this week, rising to more than $560 by the end of the day Thursday. The stock had been trading at under $400 per share as recently as October. ➽ And as if to put an exclamation point on a week of superlatives, word leaked out that in April, the entire run of Sex and the City will begin streaming on Netflix (while remaining on Max). HBO shows have been on Netflix since last summer, including the recently ended Insecure. But the presence of one of HBO’s signature series on the platform of a chief creative rival just underscored the end of that brief period where legacy media companies thought they could starve Netflix of their best IP. Two years ago in the aforementioned “panic” column, I went out of my way not to make any predictions about what that awful earnings forecast portended. But I felt pretty sure that, even if more turbulence was ahead, this rough patch wouldn’t prove fatal. “Even if Netflix continues to stumble through 2022, the odds of it having a MySpace or Napster-level extinction event, or even a WeWork-style crash, seem exceedingly low,” I wrote. “Fact is, Netflix is so far ahead in the streaming race it can afford to take big hits like what happened last week. And if growth remains sluggish, or even somehow reverses, execs have plenty of room to adjust.” Things obviously did get worse for Netflix: Three months later, it actually started losing subscribers and January’s hand-wringing suddenly seemed mild by comparison. I once again refused to make any concrete predictions since it was clear the company — and soon, the overall streaming business — had entered a serious crisis. But while I didn’t pretend to know exactly how the next phase in the so-called streaming wars would play out, I also refused to accept the idea that Netflix was suddenly Just Another Streamer. “I don’t buy into any of the darkest gloom-and-doom scenarios some Netflix skeptics continue to spread,” I wrote. “Wall Street may have broken up with the company, but it remains the world’s biggest TV platform by far.” And that, I believe, explains best why Netflix is doing so much better than its still-struggling rivals: Its size and its years-long head start perfecting streaming (the algorithm, its user interface, predicting audience behavior) simply lets it weather stormy patches like the one it went through in 2022. Netflix’s many advantages don’t make it completely bulletproof, by the way. If the broader economic trends in any of its dozens of markets turn gloomy, it can take a hit as consumers look to save money. If its programming team develops the wrong mix of shows or bets on the wrong ideas, audiences can (and will) tune out. (That $5 billion it’s spending on WWE is $5 billion that won’t go toward developing the next Stranger Things.) And while so far Netflix has been able to keep raising prices every 18 months or so — and this week hinted it might do so again soon — at some point a certain segment of the audience will simply say “enough” and unsubscribe, even if for only a few months. Netflix is not destined to always be the world’s No. 1 streamer, and it certainly is not guaranteed a repeat of a year like 2022. Instead, Netflix now feels more like ABC, CBS and NBC — the early pioneers of broadcast TV which have endured for three-quarters of a century despite massive changes to the entertainment industry. They’ve had numerous owners, experienced countless creative rebrands, and more recently have seen their status in the pop culture universe greatly diminish. And yes, they’ve also repeatedly been predicted to be five or ten years away from extinction, most recently because of the streaming revolution ushered in by Netflix. It’s possible that the networks will finally fade away; such a fate seems more likely now than ever before. But even if they do go extinct, it will only have been after a run of many, many decades. At least for now, Netflix seems poised to have a similar long and storied run. Coming Soon to Netflix: Get Ready for More Temptation Island It’s not as big as the WWE or Sex and the City, but another franchise is headed to Netflix. Buffering has learned that the streamer has snagged the rights to make new episodes of Temptation Island, the early 2000s unscripted format most recently rebooted by NBCUniversal’s USA Network. The streamer has closed a deal with producer Banijay Studios North America that will see Netflix hosting a new take on the concept, in which couples at an inflection point in their relationships head to the titular isle o’ temptation to live with a group of singles of the opposite sex. Ostensibly the goal of the show is to prompt the couples to appreciate what they have or to force them apart for good and into a new situationship; in fact, the actual point of the show is drama (which, of course, is what makes it great reality TV). The original Temptation Island ran on Fox from 2001 through 2003 (during the glory days of pioneering Reality Guru Mike Darnell) and spawned numerous international versions over the years. USA revived the series here in the States back in 2018, and it proved successful enough for the cable network to order five seasons in total, the most recent of which ended last August (and which can still be streamed on Peacock). But with USA’s increasingly tiny footprint, Temptation was limited in how much of a splash it could make in the culture. That could change when new episodes premiere on Netflix, which, time and again, has proven its ability to turn other platforms’ also-rans into hits. Temptation will be part of an already impressive roster of dating and relationship shows on the streamer, including Perfect Match, Love Is Blind, The Ultimatum, and Love on the Spectrum. David Goldberg and David Friedman will exec produce Temptation 3.0 for Banjay and Netflix. Netflix’s deal, by the way, is only for new episodes and not the library of those produced for Fox or USA.

The cups do have lead, but it isn't exposed unless the cup is damaged, a Stanley spokesperson said. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images CNN — First, Stanley cups were all over social media because so many people wanted them. Now, the oversize tumblers are back in the spotlight over fears they may contain lead. Videos on social media sites such as TikTok show people breaking out a lead testing kit and trying it on their Stanley cups and other travel flasks. It’s true: There is some lead sealed within the base of some brands of travel drinking cups — including the wildly popular brand Stanley. Lead is used as part of the tumbler’s vacuum insulation and is covered by a stainless steel layer that protects consumers from lead exposure, according to the Stanley cup manufacturer, Pacific Market International. “Our manufacturing process currently employs the use of an industry standard pellet to seal the vacuum insulation at the base of our products; the sealing material includes some lead,” a Stanley spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers.” “Rest assured that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product,” the statement said. But people on social media are nervous, considering the dangers of any exposure to lead. The toxic metal can lead to kidney problems, anemia, reproductive issues and developmental problems, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Stanley cups are everywhere. The tumblers, which come in a rainbow of colors and hold up to 40 ounces of water while still fitting in a car cup holder, have become both a status symbol and a wellness essential for those who ascribe to the “clean girl” beauty trends of hydrated, natural skin. Stanley cups are in the hands of beauty bloggers, the cars of parents at school pickup, and even on the Christmas lists of many kids this past year. Some parents have reported their children were bullied by peers if they came to school with any other brand of cup. Some water pipes may contain lead, resulting in lead exposure through drinking water. Replacing those pipes helps, but other sources of exposure remain. Grace Cary/Moment RF/Getty Images Related article Why is it important to remove lead from water pipes? A doctor explains Some caution is warranted, said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors with a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. “If the cup stays intact, there’s likely no lead exposure risk for consumers. But if that bottom seal comes off, all bets are off,” Houlihan said. “Lead is so toxic you just can’t take chances with it,” she said in an email. “If a company has to rely on their product remaining perfectly intact in order for it to be safe, that company has a basic material safety problem that they are passing on to their customers.” If the base cap of a Stanley cup does come off and exposes the seal, which is rare, the cup is eligible for replacement under the lifetime warranty, according to a statement from Stanley. Not just Stanley cups It’s not just the Stanley brand that utilizes lead. Other brands have been subject to recall over their use of the material, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. In November, the federal agency announced the recall of about 84,000 Tiblue Stainless Steel Children’s Cups and 3,600 Klickpick Home Children’s Cup Sets sold on Amazon due to “an accessible solder bead with levels of lead that exceed the federal lead content ban.” Earlier that month, some 1,600 PandaEar and 200 Laoion stainless steel children’s cups sold on Amazon were recalled for the same reasons, according to the CPSC website. And in July of last year, around 346,000 Cupkin stainless steel children’s cups were recalled by the manufacturer because they contained levels of lead that exceeded the federal lead content ban of 100 parts per million. (For water, the action level is 15 parts per billion, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.) “In general CPSC has strict regulations on lead in the content, especially for children’s products. We have issued several recalls for lead in children’s products,” said CPSC Press Secretary Patty Davis. “And we encourage consumers to report if they’re concerned about a safety hazard with a product to tell us about it at our website, which is http://www.saferproducts.gov/,” Davis said. Why lead? Why would lead be found in a drinking cup at all? “Using lead to solder is a very old manufacturing practice, which had been quite common,” said Olga Naidenko, vice president of science investigations at the Washington, DC-based Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization “dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.” “In insulated cups, lead was used in solder that seals the vacuum between the inner and the outer layer of a cup,” she said via email. “Many manufacturers are now stating that they are using alternatives to lead for sealing vacuum in those types of cups.” Any potential lead exposure is unacceptable, and companies should move to make these products without lead, Naidenko added. No safe levels of lead There is no safe level of lead for children, according to the US Consumer Product and Safety Commission. “Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect learning, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement,” the CDC said. Lead “bio-accumulates” in the body, which means it stays and builds up over time, so ongoing exposure, even at extremely low levels, can become toxic. Children, especially fetuses and infants are the most vulnerable, says the Environmental Protection Agency, because it takes very little lead exposure to damage a child compared with an adult.

(Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images/FILE Related article Cinnamon applesauce investigation finds lead levels more than 2,000 times higher than proposed standards, FDA says “A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child. In children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells,” the EPA states on its website. The main source of lead exposure in the United States comes from inhaling dust or eating particles contaminated by paint chips. That’s because lead was a common additive in house paint, gasoline and many other materials for years before its toxicity was known. Between 10% and 20% of our exposure to lead comes from contaminated water, according to experts. It’s even worse for the youngest and most vulnerable: Babies can get between 40% and 60% of their exposure to lead by drinking formula mixed with contaminated water. Many experts suggest that parents get their child’s lead level tested at ages 1 and 2, and possibly more often, depending on the area of the country. The test is easily done by a pediatrician, or at a local state, county or city department of health.

Fri, Jan 26 20244:22 PM ESTUpdated Fri, Jan 26 20244:32 PM ESTChelsey Cox@therealcoWATCH LIVEKey PointsThe FTC assessed the largest civil penalty in U.S. history against Kubota North America Corporation for falsely labeling \"Made in the USA\" on some products.The FTC assessed a civil penalty of $2 million against Kubota.The FTC issued a prior fine against the company in 1999 for falsely claiming that a line of lawn tractors was made in the U.S.Federal Trade Commission buildingJeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesWASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission on Friday announced that it fined Kubota, one of the world's largest tractor manufacturing companies, $2 million for mislabeling some of its replacement parts as \"Made in the USA.\"\"Today's settlement includes the largest civil penalty assessed for violating the Made in USA Labeling Rule,\" said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC will continue cracking down on deceptive Made in USA claims that cheat consumers and honest businesses.\" Dallas-based Kubota North America Corporation violated the 2021 rule by labeling thousands of wholly imported products or items made with significant imported materials as U.S.-made since at least 2021, according to a court order.Many package designs featuring \"Made in USA\" labels also went unchanged after production of the items was shipped overseas, according to the complaint.Kubota said in a statement that it \"cooperated fully with the FTC\" and is voluntarily addressing its concerns.\"All parts in this matter sold to customers since 2021 were produced by approved Kubota suppliers, and Kubota continues to stand behind these parts as 'Kubota Genuine Parts,'\" the company said.Aside from the fine, Kubota is restricted from claiming U.S.-origin manufacturing for its products unless it can prove that significant processing occurred in the U.S. The company must also disclose when foreign parts are used in the manufacturing process.The FTC issued a prior fine against the company in 1999 for falsely claiming that a line of lawn tractors was made in the U.S.Established in Japan during the 19th century, Kubota has grown into a global manufacturer of tractors, construction equipment and other types of machinery. It expanded into the U.S. market in 1972 with a small office in Southern California, according to The Dallas Morning News.The largest Made in USA settlement before Friday's announcement involved Resident Home LLC, a company that owns several mattress brands including Nectar Sleep and DreamCloud Sleep. The company and owner Ran Reske paid $753,000 to settle FTC charges regarding imported DreamCloud mattresses that the company claimed were made with domestic materials.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Well, it’s going to fall a lot further, according to one expert. Echoing comments this week from mega-rich crypto trader Arthur Hayes—Chris Burniske, partner at venture capital firm Placeholder—said that BTC could keep dipping. ADADThe reason? Burniske on Friday wrote on Twitter that it comes down to “macro adoption [and] new product development.”“Bitcoin [will go] to at least $30-36K before a local bottom, and [I] wouldn’t be surprised if we test the mid-to-high 20s before all is said and done,” he said. Continue to think we go lower to consolidate than most people expect due to variables that are too many to explain in detail via tweet (eg, crypto-market specific, macro, adoption, new product development). As for the denial out there... takes time for partiers to sober up, saw… — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) January 25, 2024But the former crypto lead at ARK Invest also said that over the long-term, BTC would go up and eventually touch new all-time highs. “As always, patience is your friend,” he said, adding that “the path to get there will be volatile.”ADADBTC was one the best-performing assets globally last year. It started 2023 at below $17,000 per coin and finished priced at over $42,000. But despite some experts claiming that the price would rocket following the approval and trading of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on Wall Street, the largest virtual coin has taken a battering after briefly closing in on $49,000. It is now priced at $42,083, CoinGecko data shows.The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency is still well-below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Stay on top of crypto news, get daily updates in your inbox.Your EmailGet it!Get it!ADYour gateway into the world of Web3NewsDeep DivesUniversityCoinsVideosNewslettersEvent CalendarNews ExplorerAboutTeamDisclosuresManifestoTerms of ServiceCode of Conduct1000x Member Terms of ServicePrivacy PolicySponsor & PartnerContactCareersJobsShopSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTERThe latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.Subscribe© A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."

Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeIn case the hubbub of the holidays made you forget all about (or completely miss) Amazon’s news about putting ads in Prime Video next week, we’re here to remind you that commercials are coming on Monday, January 29th — unless you pay more money, of course.Amazon just so happened to break the news right after Christmas, leaving a lovely email in users’ inboxes (that most people probably weren’t even checking at that time) to announce the rollout of ads. The new ad-free plan will cost an extra $2.99 per month, bringing your $14.99 per month Prime subscription to $17.98 per month or your $8.99 per month standalone Prime Video subscription to $11.98 per month. You won’t be automatically transferred to the new ad-free plan, but you can “preorder” the new tier from Amazon’s website.RelatedStreaming services keep getting more expensive: all the latest price increases Amazon says it’s making the change to allow it “to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time.” We also don’t know how many ads Amazon will show on the ad-supported tier, but it says it aims to “have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.” The company first announced plans to bring ads to Prime Video last September, and it’s not alone in making the change. Both Netflix and Disney Plus have also started incorporating commercials as streamers look to advertising as another source of revenue. Prime Video was one of the last big holdouts in rolling out ad-supported streaming, as Max, Paramount Plus, Hulu, and Peacock all offer plans with ads — now, all that’s left is Apple TV Plus.CommentsMost PopularTrolls have flooded X with graphic Taylor Swift AI fakesMonkey Man’s new trailer feels like a warning shot fired at John WickMozilla says Apple’s new browser rules are ‘as painful as possible’ for FirefoxMicrosoft Teams went down around the world for over eight hours — it’s better nowFossil is quitting smartwatchesVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Have an account? Log in. The Yardeni Research president said during Friday's episode of Bloomberg's \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast that he's expecting a combination of loose post-pandemic monetary policy and rapid technological change to drive growth higher over the next decade.\"It must have been pretty depressing to think about the outlook for the 1920s at the beginning of the decade,\" he said, referring to the recent end of World War I, the Spanish flu pandemic, and the recession that hit the economy in 1923. Related stories \"And yet it turned out to be the roaring 1920s because of technological innovations, things as high-tech as plumbing, auto manufacturing adapted more efficient ways of producing things, and as a result of that we had a tremendous productivity boom.\" Advertisement Yardeni said that there are comparisons to draw to today.\"There are similarities. We've had a pandemic. I think we've got a technology revolution that started in the 1990s… every company is a technology company. You either make it or you use it. If you don't use it, you're going to lose it, you're going to go out of business,\" he told Bloomberg.\"Put that all together and I think we're in the early stages of a productivity growth boom, and I think the data is already there to show that it's happening,\" he added.Yardeni's cheery outlook comes just a day after Bureau of Economic Analysis data showed that the US's Gross Domestic Product expanded by a better-than-expected 3.3% over the final quarter of 2023. The benchmark S&P 500 stock-market index is also trading at all-time highs. Advertisement His views echo those of the Swiss bank UBS, which said in November that better-than-expected growth numbers from last year would set the stage for a \"new macro regime\" that could bring about a \"Roaring '20s outcome\" for the US economy.

Porsche’s electric Macan features a 100 kWh battery pack that will reportedly be supplied by China’s CATL. Ten years after debuting the SUV, Porsche revealed the all-electric Macan Thursday. The electric Macan is Porsche’s second EV, after the Taycan and the first fully electric SUV to wear the iconic badge. The Macan EV is also the first existing Porsche model to receive an electric upgrade. With 87,355 Macan models handed over last year, the SUV plays a critical role in Porsche’s lineup. It was right behind the Cayenne (also due for an EV upgrade) with 87,553 deliveries and Porsche’s second-best seller. In comparison, Porsche delivered 40,629 Taycan electric cars in 2023. The electric Macan is expected to play a big role in Porsche’s transition to electric. Porsche’s new electric SUV is available in two variants: the Macan 4 and Macan Turbo. Powered by a 100 kWh lithium-ion battery, the base Porsche Macan 4 features up to 381 mi (613 km) WLTP range. Despite sacrificing some range (361 miles/ 591 km WLTP), the Turbo version packs 630 hp and 833 lb-ft for a 0 to 62 mph sprint (0 – 100 km/h) in 3.3 seconds. Porsche’s electric Macan will use CATL batteries Now, we are learning where Porsche is getting the batteries. According to a new report from Mobile China, Porsche’s new electric Macan will use batteries from leading Chinese battery supplier CATL. With Volkswagen using CATL’s batteries for its ID series, it makes sense that Porsche is taking a similar route. CATL also supplies Tesla, Ford, Hyundai, Toyota, Volvo, BMW, and others. The battery giant dominates the industry with a 37.4% share of the market through November 2023. CATL revealed several new battery innovations recently. In August, CATL unveiled its new Shenxing superfast charging battery. CATL claims it can add 248 miles (400 km) with ten minute-quick charge. It also revealed its Qilin Battery, launched in 2022, with 13% more power. With DC fast charging of up to 270 kW, the Macan EV can charge from 10% to 80% in about 21 minutes. At 400V stations, a high-voltage switch splits the battery into two for efficient charging. The Porsche Macan 4 EV will start at $78,800, while the Turbo version has an MSRP of $105,300. Deliveries are expected to begin in the second half of the year. Source: CarNewsChina Add Electrek to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Although they are not hurting cash-wise, they are also quite careful about their spending.Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet entered the new year by announcing more layoffs. Last year, Amazon, Google, along with Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM), trimmed their respective workforces by 6% to 13%, but layoffs started back in 2022, costing several thousand employees their jobs.New Round Of Layoffs Suggests Big Tech Bit Off More It Can ChewLast week, Google announced its job cuts across engineering and hardware teams as it continues its push for greater efficiency. Although other parts of the tech giant were affected, mostly impacted were workers in hardware, central engineering and Google Assistant voice-activated software product. As it continues to keep up with its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon, Google eliminated about 12,000 jobs last year under the leadership of Sundar Pichai.The e-commerce and cloud titan, Amazon laid off hundreds across Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions, taking the overall job cuts to 27,000. Last year alone, Amazon laid off about 18,000 employees.Cutting Jobs To Fund AI EffortsAlthough it seems like a strange time for job cuts considering that Big Tech ended 2023 by exiting the post-pandemic slump with the recovery of online advertising, Big Tech is in an expensive arms race to build AI services. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Google and Amazon opted to continue the trend of cost-cutting efforts, while streamlining operations and focusing on key projects. But even though this year will bring increased AI spending, its impact on revenue will likely be limited. Although generative AI is expected to pay out big-time, but turning GenAI magic into the desired top and bottom-line business impact will take time. Microsoft gained the early lead in the AI-race thanks to its partnership with the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, but Amazon and Google are determined to catch up and to do so, they will need to spend their billions wisely.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.
